          Let me tell you... I didn‚Äôt just code, I *struggled*. Errors? Oh, I
          had them like I had too many cups of coffee.{" "}
          <span className="text-blue-500">Syntax errors</span>,{" "}
          <span className="text-blue-500">null pointer exceptions</span>, and "
          <span className="text-blue-500">undefined is not a function</span>"
          warnings were my daily companions. My screen looked like a
          battlefield, with a pop-up warzone of red error messages. I fought my
          way through lines of code, only to be met with more bugs! But hey, who
          said the life of a programmer was easy?
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6 lexend-400">
          It took me countless sleepless nights, stacks of pizza boxes, and a
          lot of ‚ÄúGoogling‚Äù (and a bit of praying) to finally make things
          actually work. Every time I solved a problem, I felt like I had
          conquered a <span className="text-blue-500">mountain</span>. Only to
          find... there was another mountain behind it. Maybe next time, I'll
          try summiting the mountain of productivity... or at least grab another
          coffee to keep the cycle going!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6 lexend-400">
          And let‚Äôs not forget that feeling when you think you‚Äôve finally fixed
          that bug, only for a new, even more cryptic one to pop up. It‚Äôs like
          playing Whack-a-Mole, but instead of moles, you‚Äôre hitting infinite
          bugs.{" "}

            AI suggested a solution‚Ä¶ turns out, it was just a "return null"

            Despite all the jokes, AI sometimes helps me fix my code faster than
            I can Google it. But only sometimes. Other times it‚Äôs just like that
            one friend who shows up, says ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù and then leaves without

          Despite all the errors and bugs I faced, I kept pushing forward
          because there's one thing I knew for sure: the path of coding was
          always going to be this chaotic! But it‚Äôs this very chaos that makes
          the journey exciting. Also, I couldn't stop because I have no idea how

          And let's be honest, we all know the struggle of managing a dozen tabs
          open, from Stack Overflow to GitHub, while battling the urge to watch
          yet another cat video. But hey, you can‚Äôt code on an empty stomach,
          right? My productivity hacks? Pizza, caffeine, and a little bit of
          "motivational" yelling at my screen. I swear the code will work if I
          yell loud enough.
